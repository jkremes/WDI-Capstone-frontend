## Description

This app is meant to give commanders an efficient alternative to recalling their troops. The military has a requirement for troops to be able to be recalled at a moments notice. Currently, the process is long and arduous. This app is designed to make the process simple. With the tap of a finger a commander can edit the information for their subordinates. Please contact with any feedback and look out for more features in the future. Thank you!

## Instructions

1. User should sign-up if not having an account yet.
2. User should login if they are already signed-up to use the app.
3. The app allows a signed-in user to troops which act as resources to the troop list.
4. After logging in the app will take you to an index view that will allow the user to change password, logout, or see troops.
5. The change password will open a form underneath that can be hidden once the change password button is again clicked.
6. The sign-out will bring the user back to the first page where the user can then sign-up or login.
7. The see troops button will take the user to a page which shows the data table of all the users resources(troops).
8. The search function works for any dat populated in the table.
9. If the user has no resources a message will be displayed in the table which shows "Sorry, nothing to display here :(".
10. A user can add a resource by clicking the "New Troop" button.
11. Once a user has resources they can then edit or delete with the respective buttons found within that table.
12. From the see troops the user can click the 'home' button which will bring the user back to the index page.
